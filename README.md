📱 Just completed a comprehensive Web Scraping & Data Analysis project on Mobile Phone Listings from a live e-commerce site!

 🎯 Project Overview:
 Scraped, cleaned, and analyzed mobile phone data using Python—transforming raw HTML into structured insights across brands, price ranges, and technical specifications like RAM, storage, battery, and camera features.

🔧 Key Technical Skills Demonstrated:
🕸 Data Extraction & Web Scraping:
 ✅ HTTP requests and header handling (requests library)
 ✅ HTML parsing and DOM traversal (BeautifulSoup)
 ✅ CSS selector tuning for precise data capture

🧹 Data Engineering & Cleaning:
 ✅ Feature extraction and column normalization (pandas)
 ✅ Null value handling, type conversions, and outlier detection
 ✅ Brand-wise and spec-wise data merging for enriched analysis

📈 Statistical Analysis & Insights:
 ✅ Descriptive statistics and feature distributions
 ✅ Price-to-spec ratio analysis and clustering
 ✅ Correlation checks between price and performance indicators

📊 Data Visualization:
 ✅ Multi-chart storytelling with matplotlib and seaborn
 ✅ Brand comparisons using bar charts, boxplots, and heatmaps
 ✅ KDE plots for spec distribution and pricing density

🎯 Key Findings:
 📌 Analyzed 500+ mobile listings across multiple brands
 📌 Identified value-for-money clusters and spec inflation trends
 📌 Compared flagship vs budget models using feature density plots
 📌 Highlighted pricing gaps and brand positioning strategies

💡 Business Impact:
 This project showcases my ability to turn unstructured web data into actionable insights—an essential skill for e-commerce analytics, product strategy, and consumer intelligence.
